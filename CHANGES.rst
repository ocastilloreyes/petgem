Release 1.0.0
=============

This is the fist release of the all-new implementation
of *PETGEM*, which supports both CSEM and MT methods, high-order
discretizations and cuda. This release has been developed in the scope
of the PIXIL project, which is a transnational and multidisciplinary scientific
and technological cooperation. Its main goal is to develop the most advanced
tools to analyze the Earth's subsurface, with a special focus on fostering
the uptake of geothermal energy in the region. The project will contribute
to making the trans-Pyrenean area a technology hub in subsoil characterization
within two years. Its success is expected to boost the wealth and creation of
jobs related to the generation and management of underground natural
resources in the area. PIXIL has a strong research profile where scientific
collaboration between institutions prevails. The project outcomes will
result in advances in the three disciplines that make up modern geophysical
imaging: Geophysics, Applied Mathematics and Computing.

PIXIL project has been 65% cofinanced by the European Regional Development
Fund (ERDF) through the Interreg V-A Spain-France-Andorra program
(POCTEFA2014-2020). POCTEFA aims to reinforce the economic and social
integration of the French-Spanish-Andorran border. Its support is focused
on developing economic, social and environmental cross-border activities
through joint strategies favouring sustainable territorial development.
